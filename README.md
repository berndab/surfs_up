# Surfs Up

## Description

In order to determine the feasability of opening an "Surf and Shake" shop on the island of Ohau, Hawaii, this project geneates statistical data for Ohau daily multi-year temperature data for June and December. This statistical data is used to to analize and predict how the seasonal temperature variation could affect the "Surf and Shake" shop's sales volume and to determine if the type of customer  would vary with the the seasonal temperature variation.
