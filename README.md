# Surfs Up

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is determine how a proposed “Surf and Shake” shop business on the island of Oahu, Hawaii would be affected by sessional weather variations on the island. The goal is to determine how seasonal temperature variations on the island would affect the shop’s sales volume and how it would change the customer type that the shop would serve during different seasons 
## Methodology
The project uses a data set that consists of multiyear daily temperature reading from 9 weather stations the island of Oahu. The project generated statistical measures for multiyear daily temperature measures for June and December and compares these statistical measures to determine the sessional variation of these measure. 
This seasonal temperature variation data is used to predict how sales volume and customer type would be change based to the seasonal temperature variation.

## Analysis of Seasonal Weather Variations

From the statistical temperature measure for June and December, there appears to be only a slight variance in the majority of the statistical temperature values. The mean temperature difference between June and December is 3.9 degrees. The maximum temperature difference for June and December is 3 degrees. 75% of the temperatures for June are above 73 degrees while 75% of the temperatures for December are above 69 degrees. In the aggregate, the seasonal temperature variation from June and December temperature is expressed by a 3 degrees difference for the majority of the statistical weather measures.

However, the Bottom quartile daily temperatures data for June and December show a more significantly seasonal variation. The minimum temperature difference for June and December is 6 degrees which is twice the difference in the maximum temperature for June and December. In addition, the minimum temperature for December is 56 degrees is significantly lower than the preferred beach going temperature. Also, December has more outlier temperatures at the low end of the temperature scale and these additional outlier temperatures are below 60 degrees. This mean that December has more days with temperatures below the preferred beach going temperature. This increase in low temperature outlires is futher represented by the declining average temperature displayed on the December temperature chart during last week of December. This should be expected, since daily temperatures for the northern hemisphere reach their lowest values during this time frame.

The data shows that the major sesonal variation of temperature data for June and December occurs within the bottom quartile of daily temperatures for these months. December has on average has more days with marginal temperatures for beach going. 

There are four types of customers that the "Surf and Shake" shack would attract
•	Local island beach goers who purchase ice cream and shakes
•	Local island surfers who purchase surfing equipment and supplies
•	Beach going tourist who purchase ice cream and shakes
•	Beach going surfers who purchase surfing equipment and supplies

The “Surf and Shake” show would see a decrease in the number of the local island beach goer customer types and a decrease in the sales volume for ice cream and shakes purchased by this customer type in December. Due to the higher number of low temperature outliers in December, December has less days where the temperature is in the preferred temperature range of local beach goers. Local beach goer will choose to wait for those days where the temperature is not an outlier and preferable for spending a day at the beach.

The “Surf and Shake” shop would also see a decrease in the number of the beach going tourist customer type and a decrease in sales volume for ice cream and shakes purchased by this customer type in December. Beach going tourists can choose when to come to Oahu for beach going. Due to the higher number of low temperature outliers particularly in the last week of December, beach going tourist would choose to come when the chances that the daily temperatures are favorable for beach going is much higher. 

The “Surf and Shake” shop would not see a decrease in the number of the local surfer customer type and not see a decrease in sales volume of surfing equipment and supplies purchased by the local surfer customer type in December. Even though December has a higher number of low temperature outlier days this does not affect the frequency of days the local surfer customer type chooses to surf. Local surfer are motivated and prepared to surf year round and are more influenced by wave conditions than the temperature when making the choice to go surfing on a particular day. Generally, as long as wave conditions are favorable for surfing, local surfer will go surfing and will use wetsuits to stay warm on lower temperature days.

The “Surf and Shake” shop would see a decrease in the in the number of the surfing tourist customer type and a decrease in sales volume for surf equipment and supplies purchased in December. Even surfing tourist's decision to go surfing is more influence by wave condition than temperature and they usually have wet suits to use when during lower temperature days. However, surfing tourist have a choice of when to come to Oahu to surf and significantly less surfing tourist would choose to come to Oahu in December with it higher number of low temperature outlier days. they would choose to come during months like June when there is more consistent daily temperatures
